How did you react at first?

00:00.640 --> 00:02.050
Basketball Pro Julius van Sauers experienced racist abuse when he first moved to play in the UK
00:00.640 --> 00:02.050
At the time, I,

00:02.051 --> 00:04.087
I just felt like they were,

00:04.088 --> 00:07.840
honestly, just annoying neighbours. I felt like oh, we, y'know, 

00:07.841 --> 00:11.207
we got a bad one, which is unlucky...

00:11.208 --> 00:14.720
Y'know, I didn't think they had any racial...

00:14.721 --> 00:18.036
motives or anything...

00:18.037 --> 00:20.676
But once our tyres got slashed, we were

00:20.677 --> 00:22.670
just a little suspicious that

00:22.671 --> 00:24.670
something more might be going on.

00:24.671 --> 00:26.443
Y'know, we had like four

00:26.444 --> 00:28.952
flat tyres in like two weeks,

00:28.953 --> 00:31.941
that couldn't be any coincidence...

00:31.942 --> 00:34.603
So at the time, when that happened, I felt a little bit

00:34.604 --> 00:36.465
unsure and unsafe.

00:36.466 --> 00:38.589
But before that, felt pretty-

00:38.590 --> 00:40.580
we felt good, we were happy to be there and

00:40.581 --> 00:42.580
everything, y'know, we were happy with our scene,

00:42.581 --> 00:44.770
and happy for everyone...

00:44.771 --> 00:47.389
to have us in Glasgow.
