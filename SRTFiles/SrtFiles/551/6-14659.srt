What can the basketball community do to help tackle the problem?

00:00.829 --> 00:02.560
Basketball Pro Julius van Sauers experienced racist abuse when he first moved to play in the UK
00:00.829 --> 00:02.560
I think a big,

00:02.561 --> 00:05.578
a big step forward probably would be,

00:05.579 --> 00:07.294
just to understand and,

00:07.295 --> 00:09.621
have sympathy for the situation,

00:09.701 --> 00:12.370
and actually think a lot of people did that.

00:12.371 --> 00:15.650
I've had so many.. so many messages and

00:15.651 --> 00:18.945
y'know, people reaching out to us...

00:18.946 --> 00:20.596
Y'know, supporting us,

00:20.597 --> 00:24.305
that was already- that was amazing...

00:24.306 --> 00:28.632
I think racism will never really go away...

00:28.633 --> 00:32.218
So I think it's just very important to be strong as a community,

00:32.219 --> 00:36.749
and- not let it, y'know, come through, y'know what I mean?..

00:36.800 --> 00:38.850
Do not let outsiders come in and 

00:38.858 --> 00:40.850
start any racism.

00:40.851 --> 00:43.294
I think it's very important to be strong as a community,

00:43.295 --> 00:46.829
and have rules and guidelines and...

00:46.880 --> 00:48.661
that- I think that would be a great start.
