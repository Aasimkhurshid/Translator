What happened to you?

00:00.720 --> 00:03.592
Basketball Pro Julius van Sauers experienced racist abuse when he first moved to play in the UK
00:00.720 --> 00:03.592
We moved to Glasgow, me and my teammates...

00:03.600 --> 00:05.105
into one apartment,

00:05.106 --> 00:07.440
and our neighbours below...

00:07.441 --> 00:10.167
They just started complaining...

00:10.168 --> 00:12.909
about... y'know, us

00:12.910 --> 00:15.810
slamming doors and having parties and 

00:15.811 --> 00:19.185
y'know, stomping, and jumping up and down.

00:19.186 --> 00:22.240
So, they came down and knocked on the door a few times,

00:22.241 --> 00:24.683
so yeah, we talked it out and everything,

00:24.684 --> 00:27.105
just like regular neighbours and 

00:27.106 --> 00:29.687
after that, they called the cops on us...

00:29.723 --> 00:32.363
for y'know, noise complaints and stuff,

00:32.364 --> 00:36.523
and from there, it actually escalated...

00:36.524 --> 00:40.363
There were so many complaints, people were calling our team...

00:40.370 --> 00:44.036
that we were bringing prostitutes and not cleaning up our trash,

00:44.037 --> 00:46.872
and it felt like the whole neighbourhood was watching us.

00:46.873 --> 00:48.814
And... we had...

00:48.815 --> 00:52.545
at one point our cars were- the tyres were slashed,

00:52.546 --> 00:56.596
and it escalated into our cars being damaged...

00:56.610 --> 00:58.436
the windows being smashed and everything.
