What message do you have for anyone who has experienced racist abuse?

00:00.763 --> 00:03.221
Basketball Pro Julius van Sauers experienced racist abuse when he first moved to play in the UK
00:00.763 --> 00:03.221
I would say for anyone who would 

00:03.222 --> 00:06.967
suffer the same as me or my teammates...

00:06.968 --> 00:10.123
We actually- I think we handled it pretty well...

00:10.124 --> 00:15.141
by just doing what we had to do...

00:15.142 --> 00:18.472
Y'know, it's not easy but I think it's-

00:18.473 --> 00:21.054
we try to surround ourselves with people that

00:21.056 --> 00:24.996
were supporting us, y'know, like I just said...

00:24.997 --> 00:27.578
I think it's a bad idea to stay alone and 

00:27.579 --> 00:29.818
fight the situation, I think,

00:29.819 --> 00:34.014
y'know, fighting fire with fire does not make any sense.

00:34.015 --> 00:36.400
So, supportive to them,

00:36.401 --> 00:40.647
to stay with your community, with people that love you and support you,

00:40.648 --> 00:44.523
and.. I think that's the most important part.
