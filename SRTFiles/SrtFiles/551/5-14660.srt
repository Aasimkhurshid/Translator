How did your club support you?

00:00.734 --> 00:04.058
Basketball Pro Julius van Sauers experienced racist abuse when he first moved to play in the UK
00:00.734 --> 00:04.058
Well, our team, they had those calls...

00:04.059 --> 00:06.923
and when the neighbours called up they said, y'know,

00:06.924 --> 00:10.290
something along the lines of, "Get those black b******s outta here."

00:10.291 --> 00:12.763
and they were, at first, our team,

00:12.764 --> 00:16.100
they were just like, "Hey, keep it down and y'know, respect the neighbours."

00:16.101 --> 00:20.603
And we're like, "We are," and then- at one point, they believed us, y'know, that

00:20.604 --> 00:23.796
this was getting outrageous, it was getting crazy...

00:23.797 --> 00:28.770
Y'know, when you get the cops calling on you, where you're alone at home...

00:28.807 --> 00:29.840
That's just crazy.

00:29.841 --> 00:33.214
So, our team just supported us, big time...

00:33.215 --> 00:35.185
They made sure that we had everything that we needed,

00:35.180 --> 00:38.145
and... when we moved,

00:38.146 --> 00:42.480
they made quick arrangements for us, y'know, to make sure that we were safe...

00:42.501 --> 00:44.960
and that we were comfortable to keep playing basketball.

00:44.961 --> 00:47.476
So they took good care of us, they,

00:47.477 --> 00:49.789
they handled everything with the police and everything so,

00:49.790 --> 00:50.814
that was pretty good.
