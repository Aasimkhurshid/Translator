How did you deal with it personally?

00:00.938 --> 00:04.094
Basketball Pro Julius van Sauers experienced racist abuse when he first moved to play in the UK
00:00.938 --> 00:04.094
I was just, at first, a little frustrated...

00:04.095 --> 00:07.250
but I figured I was there to do a job...

00:07.270 --> 00:10.450
So, our team supported us so much...

00:10.465 --> 00:14.181
so we just got to pushing, we came here to play basketball,

00:14.182 --> 00:17.694
and we did not wanna be, y'know, bothered...

00:17.695 --> 00:20.298
y'know, hanging out with the neighbours and 

00:20.299 --> 00:22.654
y'know, bothering...

00:22.655 --> 00:26.145
Y'know, the little things, outside of practice...

00:26.146 --> 00:27.905
So yeah, we just kept it going and

00:27.906 --> 00:29.549
we're there to win games and 

00:29.550 --> 00:31.540
practice hard and just do our job. 

00:31.541 --> 00:33.540
