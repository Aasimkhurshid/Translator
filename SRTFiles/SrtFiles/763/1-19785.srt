When did your love of sport start?

00:00.467 --> 00:01.267
David Needham was diagnosed with Motor Neurone Disease in 2014 which had a major impact on his mental and physical health. 

He is the Secretary of the Leicester Tigers Wheelchair Rugby Club and also gets involved in coaching.
00:00.467 --> 00:01.267
It's hard for me 

00:01.267 --> 00:02.369
to actually put my finger on 

00:02.369 --> 00:05.071
exactly when my love for sport started,

00:05.071 --> 00:06.506
but it was a very young age. 

00:06.506 --> 00:08.241
I've got vague recollections 

00:08.241 --> 00:09.309
of going to watch my dad 

00:09.309 --> 00:10.443
and my uncle playing 

00:10.443 --> 00:13.980
in representative matches at cricket.

00:13.980 --> 00:17.350
And I think it was then that it got my goat,

00:17.350 --> 00:19.419
it really got a hold of me.

00:19.419 --> 00:21.321
But it wasn't until sort of, several years later 

00:21.321 --> 00:22.756
where I could actually start 

00:22.756 --> 00:25.592
picking a ball up and playing myself that

00:25.692 --> 00:28.194
it really took hold...

00:28.228 --> 00:30.130
Very, very young age; five, six, seven.
