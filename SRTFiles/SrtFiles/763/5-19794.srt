How did you find the support and strength you needed?

00:00.567 --> 00:01.835
David Needham was diagnosed with Motor Neurone Disease in 2014 which had a major impact on his mental and physical health. 

He is the Secretary of the Leicester Tigers Wheelchair Rugby Club and also gets involved in coaching.
00:00.567 --> 00:01.835
The support- I mean, 

00:01.835 --> 00:04.604
one of the biggest places 

00:04.604 --> 00:06.773
that I found support in, well there were two.

00:06.773 --> 00:08.742
The Motor Neuron Disease Association

00:08.742 --> 00:10.410
have been absolutely fantastic,

00:10.410 --> 00:12.412
can't knock them at all. 

00:12.412 --> 00:14.214
They're constantly, sort of 

00:14.214 --> 00:14.948
knocking on the door 

00:14.948 --> 00:15.949
saying, "You know, if anything

00:15.949 --> 00:18.952
you need, y'know, we're there," and reminding me.

00:19.319 --> 00:22.956
But the best place that I found

00:23.390 --> 00:25.025
support was going back 

00:25.025 --> 00:27.594
into the sporting environment. 

00:27.594 --> 00:29.729
Joining the Leicester Tigers Wheelchair Rugby Club,

00:30.063 --> 00:31.231
and getting involved 

00:31.231 --> 00:32.866
with Matt Hampson Foundation. 

00:32.866 --> 00:35.235
The support there has been 

00:35.235 --> 00:36.236
absolutely fantastic.
