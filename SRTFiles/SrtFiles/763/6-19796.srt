How did you become involved with Wheelchair Rugby?

00:00.700 --> 00:02.035
David Needham was diagnosed with Motor Neurone Disease in 2014 which had a major impact on his mental and physical health. 

He is the Secretary of the Leicester Tigers Wheelchair Rugby Club and also gets involved in coaching.
00:00.700 --> 00:02.035
That was my wife,

00:02.035 --> 00:04.537
as it turns out, she...

00:05.071 --> 00:08.408
she realised before me that,

00:08.408 --> 00:09.909
me stepping back from sport 

00:09.909 --> 00:12.746
was completely the wrong thing for me.

00:13.880 --> 00:17.917
And she went and knocked on the door

00:17.917 --> 00:20.053
of DMU Leisure Centre, 

00:20.053 --> 00:23.957
which is on our beat, and asked the question,

00:23.957 --> 00:26.960
you know, would I be made welcome 

00:26.960 --> 00:28.962
in the wheelchair rugby club? 

00:28.962 --> 00:31.564
And the guys were great, got me straight in,

00:31.598 --> 00:32.966
in straight in a chair,

00:32.966 --> 00:35.502
and from the first time I sat in it,

00:36.169 --> 00:37.170
and had a blast at the 

00:37.170 --> 00:38.171
game, I was hooked.
