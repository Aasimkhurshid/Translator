What advice would you give to someone who might be on similar journey?

00:00.400 --> 00:02.068
David Needham was diagnosed with Motor Neurone Disease in 2014 which had a major impact on his mental and physical health. 

He is the Secretary of the Leicester Tigers Wheelchair Rugby Club and also gets involved in coaching.
00:00.400 --> 00:02.068
Be as active as you can, and 

00:02.068 --> 00:03.503
I don't just mean physically, 

00:03.503 --> 00:06.506
physically, it works for me...

00:07.007 --> 00:07.841
If-

00:08.008 --> 00:10.844
if sports or activity

00:10.844 --> 00:13.279
really isn't your thing, then find

00:13.313 --> 00:14.781
the thing that makes you happy,

00:14.781 --> 00:17.150
and do as much of it as you can.

00:18.051 --> 00:19.019
For me, it's sport. 

00:19.219 --> 00:19.886
Be as active 

00:19.886 --> 00:21.121
as you possibly can be. 

00:21.121 --> 00:24.124
But if it really isn't your thing,

00:25.325 --> 00:26.826
do whatever makes you happy, 

00:26.826 --> 00:29.763
because that will stimulate 

00:30.063 --> 00:32.098
a positive outlook in life.
