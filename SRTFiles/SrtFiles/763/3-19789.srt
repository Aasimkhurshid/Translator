How did your diagnosis of MND occur?

00:00.367 --> 00:02.302
David Needham was diagnosed with Motor Neurone Disease in 2014 which had a major impact on his mental and physical health. 

He is the Secretary of the Leicester Tigers Wheelchair Rugby Club and also gets involved in coaching.
00:00.367 --> 00:02.302
It was a very long 

00:02.302 --> 00:04.637
and drawn out experience, 

00:04.637 --> 00:06.339
that- that sounds terrible, 

00:06.339 --> 00:08.541
but in a- in a perverse way,

00:08.541 --> 00:11.077
very much worked for me, in that

00:11.077 --> 00:12.846
I figured it out for myself 

00:12.846 --> 00:14.681
before I received the diagnosis. 

00:14.681 --> 00:17.751
I was in the medical system about 

00:17.751 --> 00:19.552
two and three quarter years,

00:20.086 --> 00:21.855
going backwards and forwards,

00:22.789 --> 00:24.958
getting asked the same questions

00:24.958 --> 00:25.959
over and over again, 

00:25.959 --> 00:28.194
and not really getting anywhere. 

00:28.194 --> 00:29.763
I did my research,

00:29.763 --> 00:32.365
I'd got a good idea of what it was about...

00:32.532 --> 00:33.733
I asked to be referred

00:33.833 --> 00:36.202
to an MND specialist,

00:36.936 --> 00:38.538
up in Sheffield,

00:38.538 --> 00:40.507
fully expecting to be told 

00:40.507 --> 00:42.108
that there was not a chance of that. 

00:42.108 --> 00:43.710
And about three months after that, 

00:43.710 --> 00:45.512
I went into hospital,

00:45.512 --> 00:46.980
for a couple of days, 

00:46.980 --> 00:48.982
had to endure a lot of tests,

00:50.116 --> 00:52.552
and then a fortnight later, got a call

00:52.952 --> 00:54.020
to go back up to Sheffield,

00:54.020 --> 00:55.922
and we had the news broken to us,

00:56.122 --> 00:58.892
and like I said, it came as no shock to me.
