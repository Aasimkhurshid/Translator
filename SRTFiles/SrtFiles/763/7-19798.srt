It has a direct impact... mental

00:04.371 --> 00:06.539
my- I have struggled with

00:07.640 --> 00:08.908
dark days...

00:09.909 --> 00:12.145
both before the diagnosis,

00:12.145 --> 00:14.214
MND diagnosis, and after.

00:14.914 --> 00:16.983
But I've always found

00:17.350 --> 00:19.519
that staying as active as possible,

00:19.519 --> 00:21.721
and being in that sporting environment,

00:21.721 --> 00:24.090
has- has evened the playing field for me.

00:25.291 --> 00:26.793
And that's a consistent thing.
