Well, it's a while ago now,

00:01.935 --> 00:04.504
but I was about 38/39,

00:05.038 --> 00:08.775
and as it turned out, it was caused by

00:09.776 --> 00:12.212
injuries that were down to the motor

00:12.212 --> 00:13.013
neurones disease,

00:13.013 --> 00:14.914
but at the time, I was completely 

00:14.914 --> 00:15.648
unaware of that.
