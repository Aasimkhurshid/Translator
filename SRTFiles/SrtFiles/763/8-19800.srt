What have been the biggest lessons you've learned from your experience?

00:00.500 --> 00:02.369
David Needham was diagnosed with Motor Neurone Disease in 2014 which had a major impact on his mental and physical health. 

He is the Secretary of the Leicester Tigers Wheelchair Rugby Club and also gets involved in coaching.
00:00.500 --> 00:02.369
The one that stands out 

00:02.369 --> 00:04.404
for me and it's huge, 

00:04.404 --> 00:06.573
and I wish I could go back 

00:06.573 --> 00:08.074
and relive that,

00:08.074 --> 00:09.509
sort of part of my life.

00:09.509 --> 00:12.912
When I was getting towards the end of

00:14.347 --> 00:16.549
my time playing able bodied sports,

00:16.916 --> 00:18.018
and picking up injuries, 

00:18.018 --> 00:19.219
left, right, centre - that

00:20.120 --> 00:23.289
was down to MND as it turned out.

00:23.857 --> 00:27.093
I interpreted it as just my body saying,

00:27.093 --> 00:28.228
"Enough's enough. 

00:28.228 --> 00:30.597
You've had 39 great years,

00:30.864 --> 00:32.132
now knock it on the head,

00:32.132 --> 00:33.633
go and find something different to do."

00:33.633 --> 00:35.301
That was a huge mistake. 

00:35.301 --> 00:37.771
That effectively opened the door 

00:37.771 --> 00:40.040
for MND to come in and take hold.

00:41.141 --> 00:42.375
While I've been active,

00:42.375 --> 00:44.644
I've been very conscious 

00:44.644 --> 00:46.646
that the MND's progression 

00:46.646 --> 00:47.781
has been very slow.

00:47.781 --> 00:49.282
When I'm inactive,

00:49.282 --> 00:50.650
it seems to catch up with me 

00:50.650 --> 00:51.451
an awful lot quicker. 

00:51.451 --> 00:54.220
So, the two years that I spent

00:54.788 --> 00:56.689
not playing sports, 

00:56.689 --> 00:59.025
I would not do that again.
