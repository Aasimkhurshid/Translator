Kate, my wife, 

00:03.036 --> 00:05.739
broke down into tears, 

00:05.739 --> 00:07.674
even though I'd sat down 

00:07.674 --> 00:09.409
and discussed with her 

00:09.409 --> 00:10.577
what I thought it was. 

00:10.577 --> 00:12.512
I think she really was hoping 

00:12.512 --> 00:14.881
it wasn't going to be that but

00:15.348 --> 00:17.450
at- at that point, the, my- my

00:17.450 --> 00:19.052
sort of, what I tried to convey to her

00:19.252 --> 00:20.987
was that, yeah, it's bad news,

00:20.987 --> 00:22.422
but it's not the end of the world.
