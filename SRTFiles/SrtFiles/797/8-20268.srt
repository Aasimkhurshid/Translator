How have you been able to remain cancer free since then? 

00:00.467 --> 00:03.603
Carol was diagnosed with bowel cancer 16 years ago
00:00.467 --> 00:03.603
They were very good, they kept me on their books, 

00:03.603 --> 00:08.641
so to speak, for a good 6 years afterwards.

00:08.641 --> 00:10.877
I would have various colonoscopies 

00:10.877 --> 00:14.247
at various stages to check that everything was okay. 

00:14.247 --> 00:17.751
I mean, the aftercare was fantastic.

00:17.751 --> 00:20.320
After that, I guess some, you know, 

00:20.320 --> 00:23.990
I've just felt well, luckily, and,

00:23.990 --> 00:27.994
kind of, kept healthy by healthy diet

00:27.994 --> 00:32.432
and plenty of exercise and that kind of stuff, really.
