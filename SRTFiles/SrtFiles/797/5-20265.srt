How did the chemotherapy affect you physically and emotionally? 

00:00.300 --> 00:03.636
Carol was diagnosed with bowel cancer 16 years ago
00:00.300 --> 00:03.636
Physically, it gets worse as it goes along.

00:03.636 --> 00:08.942
I had 6 months, a course of 6 months treatments.

00:08.942 --> 00:12.412
The first month, I guess, wasn't so bad

00:12.412 --> 00:13.913
and I thought, "<i>What's all the fuss about?</i>",

00:13.913 --> 00:16.683
because you hear things about chemotherapy.

00:16.683 --> 00:19.119
It got progressively worse, probably

00:19.119 --> 00:22.956
the worst month of all was the fourth month,

00:22.956 --> 00:26.059
and then it got better again.

00:26.059 --> 00:30.263
Emotionally, I mean, I just guess you get on with it, really,

00:30.263 --> 00:33.633
because, you know, it's a necessary evil.
