What stage was your bowel cancer when you were eventually diagnosed? 

00:00.500 --> 00:02.836
Carol was diagnosed with bowel cancer 16 years ago
00:00.500 --> 00:02.836
It was quite late on because, as I said, 

00:02.836 --> 00:04.170
I'd been going to the doctor 

00:04.170 --> 00:07.841
for 18 months and had various things, 

00:07.841 --> 00:12.545
you know, like blood tests, and so on and so forth. 

00:12.545 --> 00:16.850
So, it was probably Stage-, well,

00:16.850 --> 00:20.620
it was definitely Stage 3, but almost going into Stage 4.
