What advice would you give to people who are struggling to have their symptoms recognised? 

00:00.367 --> 00:04.304
Carol was diagnosed with bowel cancer 16 years ago
00:00.367 --> 00:04.304
There's a good resource now on Bowel Cancer UK website,

00:04.304 --> 00:07.640
there's a little diary that you can- you can download. 

00:07.640 --> 00:13.113
I didn't have it in my day, I don't even know if I kept notes, but

00:13.113 --> 00:17.617
I would certainly recommend that, that anyone that's worried, 

00:17.617 --> 00:21.121
and feels that their symptoms are ongoing, 

00:21.121 --> 00:23.656
and nothing seems to be happening to them, 

00:23.656 --> 00:28.328
I would certainly keep a diary and keep pursuing, 

00:28.328 --> 00:29.629
you know, keep pursuing it. 

00:29.629 --> 00:34.267
And, actually earlier on, as well, I think I would have asked 

00:34.267 --> 00:37.370
to see a different doctor, because I was seeing 

00:37.370 --> 00:41.674
the same one throughout, so I would recommend that as well.

00:42.175 --> 00:45.045
But don't give up, because, you know, 

00:45.045 --> 00:46.780
if you- if you do feel there's something wrong, 

00:46.780 --> 00:50.984
it's your body, you know it better than anybody else, and you know,

00:50.984 --> 00:53.486
I would recommend that you just pursue that.
