How soon after your diagnosis did you start chemotherapy? 

00:00.500 --> 00:02.002
Carol was diagnosed with bowel cancer 16 years ago
00:00.500 --> 00:02.002
I had to have chemotherapy 

00:02.002 --> 00:06.072
because it was quite a late stage diagnosis.

00:06.072 --> 00:08.108
But the general view, I think, is

00:08.108 --> 00:10.043
that you have to give your body time 

00:10.043 --> 00:13.346
to recover, sort of, so it was probably 6 weeks 

00:13.346 --> 00:16.950
after I had the surgery, yeah.
