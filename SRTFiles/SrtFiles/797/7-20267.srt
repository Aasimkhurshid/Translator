What support was available to you?

00:00.533 --> 00:03.570
Carol was diagnosed with bowel cancer 16 years ago
00:00.533 --> 00:03.570
Basically, from friends and family, there wasn't really a lot, 

00:03.570 --> 00:06.639
there was a little centre that was quite far away. 

00:06.639 --> 00:09.709
There was nothing really online in those days,

00:09.709 --> 00:11.845
we're talking 16 years ago. 

00:11.845 --> 00:15.715
Nowadays, there's a fantastic website

00:15.715 --> 00:18.985
that Bowel Cancer UK have produced,

00:18.985 --> 00:22.722
and it really is amazing and you can get loads 

00:22.722 --> 00:24.991
and loads of support from that website, 

00:24.991 --> 00:29.262
and you can also get lots of information,

00:29.262 --> 00:34.000
medical information, and- and other, kind of, just general support.
