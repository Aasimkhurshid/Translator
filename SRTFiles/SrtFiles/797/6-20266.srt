What helped you keep positive and motivated throughout your treatment? 

00:00.467 --> 00:03.937
Carol was diagnosed with bowel cancer 16 years ago
00:00.467 --> 00:03.937
I think I'm pretty positive as people go anyway, 

00:03.937 --> 00:09.542
I try to think positive, think about, you know, positive things. 

00:09.542 --> 00:12.579
I found it- I like walking a lot, but I found that 

00:12.579 --> 00:16.583
the chemotherapy actually zaps your energy. 

00:16.583 --> 00:19.953
And you know, you really aren't one for,

00:19.953 --> 00:21.021
you know, if you're going through 

00:21.021 --> 00:24.391
that kind of treatment, you're not- not really ready to go out 

00:24.391 --> 00:28.194
and- and, you know, do a 5 mile hike or whatever.

00:28.194 --> 00:32.065
So that would be, you know, the first thing

00:32.065 --> 00:35.802
that I would think about, but I don't think that's always possible.

00:35.802 --> 00:40.206
So I think you just got to think of positive thoughts and, 

00:40.206 --> 00:43.843
you know, friends and family keep you positive as well.
