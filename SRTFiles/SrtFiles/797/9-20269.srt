If someone thinks they might have symptoms, what would you recommend they do?

00:00.500 --> 00:03.603
Carol was diagnosed with bowel cancer 16 years ago
00:00.500 --> 00:03.603
Well, I think there are a list of symptoms. 

00:03.603 --> 00:06.506
I think most people say that if you've got- 

00:06.506 --> 00:08.942
if you find blood in your poo, then that's, 

00:08.942 --> 00:10.477
you know, that's the first thing. 

00:10.477 --> 00:13.146
The first thing you should do really is go to your GP. 

00:13.146 --> 00:16.616
I didn't have that symptom, I just had this- this pain in my side 

00:16.616 --> 00:19.085
that just went on and on and on. 

00:19.085 --> 00:23.623
But unfortunately, as I said, I had a bit of a bad experience, 

00:23.623 --> 00:27.460
and I wasn't really, the diagnosis wasn't

00:27.460 --> 00:31.231
picked up really for, as I said, 18 months and I saw different 

00:31.231 --> 00:35.668
doctor in the end, luckily, and he sent me 

00:35.668 --> 00:39.139
immediately for treatment to A&E,

00:39.139 --> 00:41.908
and I had a scan and an X-ray,

00:41.908 --> 00:44.744
and that's really when things started to happen.
